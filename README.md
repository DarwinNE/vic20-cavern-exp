#Cavern Explorer

By Davide Bucci

This is a game for the unexpanded Commodore VIC-20 (PAL or NTSC).
A spaceship is at your commands to explore a vast cavern discovered on planet Zorf.
You control the spaceship with the Z,S and X keys to move it to the left, upwards and to the right respectively.
You can move the ship very fast, but beware of momentum!

Advance as much as you can in the cavern, collect pulsating rings and avoid carnivorous plants shooting deadly slime.

Compile the sources with "make", you will need the ca65 assembler installed in your system.
